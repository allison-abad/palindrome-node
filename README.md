# Palindrome
This assignment will take a word ,reverse it, and get the same word when placed back together. If the word did not come out the same as it did when first inputed the user would see Not a palindrome alert, otherwise user would be notified the word chosen indeed is a palindrome. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** 
*HTML
*css
*JavaScript

For this assignment, I had to build a function that would use methods to command code to split from a word into letters, to then reversing their order and being grouped together again to create the same word it  previously was.
.. Will run while running on a server port 8000.

## Lessons Learned:
I learned how to code a function that displayed a Plaindrome and as well how to code conditionals within a server.js file.
